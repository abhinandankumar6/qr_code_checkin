#	Flask QR Code Check-In App
Overview
The Flask QR Code Check-In App is a web-based application that tracks user check-ins and provides tailored responses based on user data. The application uses a CSV file to manage user information and integrates QR codes and session handling to enhance user flow.

•	Session Management: Tracks user activity to control behavior like reloading pages.
•	Dynamic Responses: Tailored templates based on user data and actions.
•	CSV File Management: Reads and updates user details, such as check-in status and counts.
•	Redirect on Page Reload: Redirects users to the homepage upon reloading specific pages (e.g., the welcome page).

Usage
Check-In Process
1.	Navigate to the home page.
2.	Enter the unique code for check-in.
3.	Based on the user's data:
o	First Check-In: Status is updated to "Checked-In," and count is incremented.
o	Subsequent Check-Ins: Only the count is incremented.
o	Maximum Check-Ins: Displays a message like "Come back next year."
o	Unregistered Users: Shows an error message.
Handling Reloads
If the user reloads the welcome page, they are redirected to the homepage to prevent unintended behavior.
